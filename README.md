These warnings are related to line endings in your files. Git is informing you that the line endings in your files will be converted from LF (Line Feed) to CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) the next time Git processes them. This is common when working across different operating systems (e.g., Linux vs. Windows).

To address this, you can configure Git to handle line endings consistently. Here are a few options:

1. Set Git to Automatically Handle Line Endings
You can set Git to automatically convert line endings appropriately for your operating system:

For Windows:
git config --global core.autocrlf true
This setting converts LF to CRLF when checking out code and converts CRLF to LF when committing code.
For macOS/Linux:
git config --global core.autocrlf input
This setting converts CRLF to LF when committing code but leaves LF unchanged when checking out code.
2. Normalize Line Endings in Your Repository
You can normalize the line endings in your repository by adding a .gitattributes file to the root of your project with the following content:

* text=auto

Then, add and commit this file:

git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add .gitattributes to normalize line endings"

3. Ignore Line Ending Differences
If you want to ignore line ending differences, you can use:

git config --global core.safecrlf false

After configuring one of these options, you can proceed with your commit and push:

Add and Commit Your Files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

These steps should help you manage line endings and avoid related warnings. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

This error occurs because the remote repository contains changes that you don’t have in your local repository. To resolve this, you need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository and then push your changes. Here are the steps:

1. Pull the Latest Changes
First, pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

git pull origin main

This will fetch and merge the changes from the remote main branch into your local main branch.

2. Resolve Any Merge Conflicts
If there are any merge conflicts, Git will notify you. You’ll need to resolve these conflicts manually. Open the conflicting files, make the necessary changes, and then add the resolved files:

git add <file_with_conflict>

3. Commit the Merge
After resolving any conflicts, commit the merge:

git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

4. Push Your Changes
Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

git push origin main

These steps should help you synchronize your local repository with the remote one and successfully push your changes. Let me know if you encounter any issues or need further assistance!

Dataset
Usage
Analysis

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib jupyter

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Fitbit. It includes various metrics such as steps, heart rate, sleep patterns, and more.

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fitbit_Tracker_Analysis.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Fitbit_Tracker_Analysis

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Open the Fitbit_tracker_analysis.ipynb file and run the cells to perform the analysis.
Analysis
The analysis is divided into several sections:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand trends and patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to derive insights.
Visualization: Creating plots and charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib
